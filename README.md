# ALGORITHMS

An algorithm is a set of instructions that perform a task.

## Objectives

This repository was created to provide an in-depth study of the book "Understanding Algorithms" by Aditya Y. Bhargava. Here, I will include the code exercises from the book, implemented in Java. While the exercises in the book are originally presented in Python, I've chosen to use Java to practice implementing algorithms in a language I use daily. This approach allows me to reinforce my understanding of the algorithms while applying them in a different programming context.

## Topics Covered

- Chapter 1: Binary Search;
- Chapter 2: Selection Sort;
- Chapter 3: Recursion;
- Chapter 4: Quicksort;
